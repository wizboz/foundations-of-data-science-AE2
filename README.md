### Sentimental

This Python Notebook aims to perform Sentiment Analysis on the SST-2 dataset. I compare and contrast the efficiency of both Count Vectorization and TF-IDF Vectorization methods with a variety of traditional machine learning models. After the best model combination has been determined, I use feature selection algorithms to evaluate the importance of feature selection and tune the classifier's hyperparameters in order to improve the models accuracy. Overall, an classification accuracy of 92.99% and 83.72% was achieved on the training and testing data respectively.
